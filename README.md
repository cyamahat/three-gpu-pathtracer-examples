## three-gpu-pathtracer (examples)

*[three-gpu-pathtracer]((https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-gpu-pathtracer)* is a path tracing project using [three-mesh-bvh](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-mesh-bvh) and WebGL 2 to accelerate high quality, physically based rendering (PBR) on the GPU. Features include support for GGX surface model, material information, textures, normal maps, emission, environment maps, tiled rendering, and more.

This Github project demonstrates how *three-gpu-pathtracer* can be used to realistically simulate PBR of optical prisms.
The optical elements chosen for this demonstration are the **Dove prism**, the **right-angle prism**, and the **Amici roof prism**.
Finally, when this three prisms are combined together, we get the basic optics of a **panoramic telescope** (or Rundblickfernrohr, in German).
