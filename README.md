## three-gpu-pathtracer (examples)

*[three-gpu-pathtracer](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-gpu-pathtracer)* is a path tracing library leveraging [three-mesh-bvh](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-mesh-bvh) and WebGL 2 to deliver high-quality, 
physically based rendering (PBR) on the GPU. Key features include support for the GGX surface model, materials information, textures, normal maps, emission, environment maps, tiled rendering, and more.

This Github project showcases *three-gpu-pathtracer*'s ability to simulate realistic PBR for optical parts.
The demonstration focuses on three optical prisms: the **Dove prism**, the **right-angle prism**, and the **Amici roof prism**.
When combined, these prisms form the core optical system of a **panoramic telescope** (or *Rundblickfernrohr* in German).
