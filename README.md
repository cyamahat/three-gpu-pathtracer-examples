# PBR of Optical Elements with *three-gpu-pathtracer*

The *[three-gpu-pathtracer](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-gpu-pathtracer)* library
leverages [three-mesh-bvh](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-mesh-bvh) and WebGL 2 to deliver high-quality, 
physically based rendering (PBR) on the GPU. Key features include support for the GGX surface model, materials information, textures, normal maps, emission, environment maps, tiled rendering. As a result, path tracing also supports reflection and refraction of optical materials!

This GitHub repository demonstrates *three-gpu-pathtracer*'s ability to simulate realistic PBR for optical parts.
The demonstration focuses on three standard optical prisms: the **Dove prism**, the **right-angle prism**, and the **Amici roof prism**. When combined, these prisms form the core optical system of a **panoramic telescope** (or ùïΩùñöùñìùñâùñáùñëùñéùñàùñêùñãùñäùñóùñìùñóùñîùñçùñó in German).

<br/>***Amici Roof Prism vs. Right-Angle Prism***. *The image output from a prism is either right-handed or left-handed*
<br/>*(i.e., mirrored), determined by the number of internal reflections within the prism.*

***Panoramic Telescope***. *When the right-angle prism undergoes azimuth rotation by an angle theta (Œ∏),*
<br/>*rotating the Dove prism by half theta (Œ∏/2) ensures the output image remains horizontal.*
