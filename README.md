## three-gpu-pathtracer (examples)

The path tracing library *[three-gpu-pathtracer](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-gpu-pathtracer)* 
leverages [three-mesh-bvh](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-mesh-bvh) and WebGL 2 to deliver high-quality, 
physically based rendering (PBR) using local computation on the GPU. 

The author of this library highlights several key features, including support for the GGX surface model, materials information, 
textures, normal maps, emission, environment maps, tiled rendering. As a result, path tracing also supports reflection and 
refraction of optical materials!

This Github project showcases *three-gpu-pathtracer*'s ability to simulate realistic PBR for optical parts.
The demonstration focuses on three standard optical prisms: the **Dove prism**, the **right-angle prism**, and the **Amici roof prism**.
When combined, these prisms form the core optical system of a **panoramic telescope** (or *Rundblickfernrohr* in German).
